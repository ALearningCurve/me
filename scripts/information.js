        brief: `Worked on this project at my internship at Community Software Group. This project made a web interface for administrators to access and update sound files and other configurations options for their IVR (automatic phone system). This project is very important because there are way too many agencies for developers to manually update the files and agency administrators for a lack of knowledge and security reasons can't modify the files on the server themselves.`,

        brief: `This is another project that I worked on at Community Software Group (CSG) aiming to solve the issue of standardizing the process of importing data into Engage, a system at CSG. The system before this project is following a 30 page PDF to create a CSV by hand, which obviously isn't the best idea.

    We made this tool to convert an excel sheet of data into a data table on the backend with the original data being transformed into a format that works while all the user has to do is label the original column in our web app.
    
    This project is necessary because each of our clients use different software that exports the data in a different format, so having an easy to use website that works for all excel files is crucial.`,

Pets are customizable, can have arbitrary amounts of animations, and can easily be added by editing a config file. When run, the pets will cycle animations, move around the sreen by themselves, or be moved by the user's mouse.`,

        img: "images/projects/nlpp.png",
        brief: `This is a project I did to enhance the reading and learning experience for students learning other languages. By adopting a format similar to google classroom, students can easily join online classrooms (called groups) and which teachers can easily moderate and control. The groups allow teachers to assign readings which students can interact with, such as by double clicking a word, to get a synonym of that word in the target foreign language and a translation after another successive click. The program will keep track of the students' clicks and allow the teacher to see what words they might need to spend more time on with the class. With built in image, pdf, and word document text extraction 
    (nlp) the program strives to be as user friendly for teachers to upload resources
    
    This site also makes us of authentication logic and databases. The site utilizes required log in checks for most pages, a hashing algorithm, cross-site scripting protection by escaping HTML, form validation to ensure that data is properly entered, and checks user against the owner of a post or group to prevent malicious actions.
    
    Overall I am super proud of this project and hope to make this project a real thing in the future!`,
